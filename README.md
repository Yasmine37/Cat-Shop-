# Cat-Shop-
I developed a Cat Accessories Shop Website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It showcases different cat products with a clean and responsive design, making it easy to browse items. I focused on creating a user-friendly interface with styled layouts and smooth navigation to give the feel of a real online shop.
